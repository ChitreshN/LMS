## A personal learning management system

Implemented API's for creating, viewing, updating and deleting

### Functionality

1. Can create courses and manage the related resources and assignments
2. Update status of courses and assignments according to the progress


### Future plans
1. Implement a CLI app to manage the courses
2. Rewrite in Go, cause Javascript is a headache, not that it matters
    in terms of performance for this small application
3. (Let someone work on the frontend if they are interested)
4. Send a mail if deadline is approaching
